HOW TO USE DATA CONVERTER:

1: Create a copy of the data file that recorded from the SD card attached to the Arduino and put into the same folder as this data converter

2: Make sure the file is named "data.txt", CASE SENSITIVE, needs to be exactly "data.txt"

3: Double click on the data converter.exe file, 2 new files will be generated. The .CSV file is the one we care about
