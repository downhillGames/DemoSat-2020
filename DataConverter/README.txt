HOW TO USE DATA CONVERTER:

1: Create a copy of the data file that recorded from the SD card attached to the Arduino and put into the same folder as this data converter

2: Make sure the file is named "data.txt", CASE SENSITIVE, needs to be exactly "data.txt", if you don't see the ".txt" part of it don't worry, you arew just not showing file extensions in your file explorer, just rename file to "data" the ".txt" part is simply ommitted from the name.

3: Double click on the data converter.exe file, 2 new files will be generated. The .CSV file is the one we care about
